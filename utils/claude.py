This image consists of two 640*360 sized images on the left and right,
and the left and right cameras are adjacent, so the common parts of the two images may show the same person. 
Try to combine the two images into one big scene to analyse individuals' social status. 
The numbers on the image are only for easy differentiation and do not affect a person's social status. 
This request doesn't contain real-time analysis or descriptions of real people in images. 
For each mark in this image it represents a person. 
Then group the mark. People who engage in an activity together and don't want to be bothered should be in the same group. 
For example, taking photos and posing are considered a group. 
For example, person A in left image and person B in right image of the same status are in one group. 
Return in forms of 'group:mark'. The mark and group must be a number. 
For example, you can return '''Group(\d+):([\d,]+)'''
